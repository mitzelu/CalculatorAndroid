    ![screen1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitzelu/CalculatorAndroid/master/screens/allscreens.png)


The can execute basic operations like ```+``` , ```-``` , ```x``` , ```รท``` only on two operands. 
The given by user values are shown on ``intermediaryScreen`` and final result on ``mainScreen``. It also has the feature to make operations on final result, for example to add some value to it. The result is shown in ```float format```. 
Button ```CE``` erase characters one by one, since ```C``` erase all.

In order to make my app to work on different screen sizes I created 3 ```value``` files for ``normal`` , ``large`` and ``xlarge`` screen.


## TODO

 - add actions to buttons ```+/_ ``` and ```( )```
 - make the app to allow multiple operands
